## Dominant Color Extraction for Image Segmentation
- Segmentation partitions an image into regions having similar visual appearance corresponding to parts of objects
- We will try to extract the most dominant 'K' Colors using K-Means
- We can apply K-Means with each pixel will reassigned to the closest of the K Colors, leading to segmentation
